 A web-app game where you try to figure out in a 3x3 grid which words relate to each other.

 This app uses Robot Framework, Heroku and Github Actions to create a small CI/CD pipeline where the pushes done to the projects dev branch are first tested by automated tests, and merges to main are then automatically deployed to heroku.
